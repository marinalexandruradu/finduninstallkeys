Uninstalling applications from our systems is a common task that we all encounter from time to time. Sometimes, finding the right uninstallation information for an application can be a challenge. Fortunately, PowerShell comes to the rescue with its ability to search for application uninstall keys in the Windows registry.

The Windows registry holds crucial information about installed applications, including their uninstallation details. With a simple PowerShell script, we can effortlessly retrieve this information and make our uninstallation process much smoother.
This script allows us to search for application uninstall keys in the Windows registry by utilizing the predefined registry paths where uninstall information is typically stored. It retrieves important properties such as the application name, uninstall command, version, publisher, and install location.
